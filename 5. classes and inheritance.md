# Programming Language Project
for CS 330: Structure and Organization of Programming Language


## Classes
There are **constructors** which Julia defines as functions that create new objects but since Julia is not an object-oriented program, there are no classes per-se. However, since Julia is a multi-paradigm language, it has capabilities that support object-oriented programming which is why people tend to get confused since it is done in a different manner as well.

The `struct` constructor serves as a constructor function.

```julia
struct Example
  a
  b
end

example = Example(x, y)
Example(x, y)
```

Like aforementioned, Julia is **_not_** an OOP which means that functions can live outside of the struct. In languages similar to Python, functions (or variables, data types, etc.) relating to a specific class have to reside within that class in order to be accessed. In the code above, `end` is used to signify the stopping point of a struct. Any methods that work for this sruct should come afterâ€”placing it within could lead to an error.

## Inheritance

While children classes in Python can have multiple superclasses, Julia only allows **one** supertype.

## Multiple Dispatch
Continuing the discussion from the last topic, [Loops and Functions](https://github.com/alexcana/plp/blob/main/4.%20loops%20and%20functions.md), Julia implements the use of the multiple dispatch paradigm, which is one of its selling points. Say you have a function that takes in either a parameter or multiple parameters whose values can vary. Multiple dispatch is a system that allows the programming language to basically choose which function to execute based on the argument that is passed through when the function is called. Because stating data types is something that is not required in Julia, we do not have to specify what data type is to be expected (if any) when writing a function. In Java, if a function takes in a parameter, we would have to specify the data types of the parameters it is taking in, such as: `public void function(int x)` or `public void function(String x, int y)`.

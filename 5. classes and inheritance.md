## Classes
There are **constructors** which Julia defines as functions that create new objects but since Julia is not an object-oriented program, there are no classes per-se. However, since Julia is a multi-paradigm language, it has capabilities that support object-oriented programming which is why people tend to get confused since it is done in a different manner as well.

The `struct` constructor serves as a constructor function.

```julia
struct Example
  a
  b
end

example = Example(x, y)
Example(x, y)
```

Like aforementioned, Julia is **_not_** an OOP which means that functions can live outside of the struct. In languages similar to Python, functions (or variables, data types, etc.) relating to a specific class have to reside within that class in order to be accessed. In the code above, `end` is used to signify the stopping point of a struct. Any methods that work for this sruct should come afterâ€”placing it within could lead to an error.

# Programming Language Project
for CS 330: Structure and Organization of Programming Language


## Classes
There are **constructors** which Julia defines as functions that create new objects but since Julia is not an object-oriented program, there are no classes per-se. However, since Julia is a multi-paradigm language, it has capabilities that support object-oriented programming which is why people tend to get confused since it is done in a different manner as well.

The `struct` constructor serves as a constructor function.

```julia
struct Example          # Struct begins with a capital letter for convention
  a                     
  b
  
  function Example()    # constructor name as function name 
    do stuff
  end
end

example = Example(x, y)
```

Like aforementioned, Julia is **_not_** an OOP which means that functions can live outside of the struct. In languages similar to Python, functions (or variables, data types, etc.) relating to a specific class have to reside within that class in order to be accessed. In the code above, `end` is used to signify the stopping point of a struct. Any methods that work for this sruct should come afterâ€”placing it within could lead to an error.

## Multiple Dispatch
Continuing the discussion from the last topic, [Loops and Functions](https://github.com/alexcana/plp/blob/main/4.%20loops%20and%20functions.md), Julia implements the use of the multiple dispatch paradigm, which is one of its selling points. Say you have a function that takes in either a parameter or multiple parameters whose values can vary. Multiple dispatch is a system that allows the programming language to basically choose which function to execute based on the argument that is passed through when the function is called. Because stating data types is something that is not required in Julia, we do not have to specify what data type is to be expected (if any) when writing a function. In Java, if a function takes in a parameter, we would have to specify the data types of the parameters it is taking in, such as: `public void function(int x)` or `public void function(String x, int y)`.

## Putting It Together

Creating a new struct using what we just learned would look something like this:

```julia
struct Pet
  name
  age
  weight
  
  function Pet()            # no parameters (multiple dispatch)
    new("None", 0, 0)
  end
  
  function Pet(n, a)        # only two parameters (multiple dispatch)
    new(n, a, 0)
  end
  
  function Pet(n, a, w)     # all parameters (multiple dispatch)
    new(n, a, w)
  end
end
```

Putting it to use would look like this:

```julia
p1 = Pet("Scooby", 8, 75)
p2 = Pet("Thomas", 10)
```

## Inheritance

While children classes in Python can have multiple superclasses, Julia only allows **one** supertype for each child which means it can only inherit from one parent.

Building onto the code we used earlier, we can create a Dog and Cat struct to extend the Pet struct as well as create new functions that return its breeds.

```julia
struct Dog
    dog::Pet
    breed
end

struct Cat
    cat::Pet
    breed
end

function getBreed(dog)
    return ("Breed type: " * dog.breed)
end

function getBreed(cat)
    return ("Breed type: " * cat.breed)
end
```

```julia
p3 = Dog(Pet("Benedict", 5), "Rhodesian Ridgeback")
p4 = Cat(Pet("Willbur", 9), "Ragdoll")
```

`println(p3)`'s output: `Dog(Pet("Benedict", 5, 0), "Rhodesian Ridgeback")` and `println(p4)`'s output: `Cat(Pet("Willbur", 9, 0), "Ragdoll")`.

You could get these to print out prettier by importing `display` or creating a new function that would be the equivalent  `toString` in Java. Notice how I did not include a `println(p3.name)` (currently unsure of how to print a parent variable but will get back to it).

`println(getBreed(p3))`'s output: `Breed type: Rhodesian Ridgeback`
`println(getBreed(p4))`'s output: `Breed type: Ragdoll`

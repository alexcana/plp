# Programming Language Project
for CS 330: Structure and Organization of Programming Language


## The History behind Julia
>1. What is the name of your language?

Julia

>2. When/where was it created, and by whom? Was is written to address a particular problem or need?

Julia was created as an open-source project in 2009 by a group of four co-creators: ***Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, and Alan Edelman.*** Because these four computer scientists had programming backgrounds in different languages—some Matlab, some Lisp, some Python, Ruby, Perl—they came to a common agreement that while these languages were powerful and effective in what they were used for, there were tons of tradeoffs. They wanted to create a language that basically had it all. 

>3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.

While Julia is described to a general-purpose language, programmers mainly use it for computational and numerical analysis. 

>4. Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.

## Getting Started with Julia
>1. What did you need to do to install the language?

You would need to install Julia, the language, onto your computer. You can do this by accessing the [official website for Julia](https://julialang.org/). There will be a button that will say "Download" + the current stable version of Julia. Clicking it will redirect you to the download page where you will be able to choose which version of Julia to download and for which operating system you have.

>2. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using?

On the [official website for Julia](https://julialang.org/), they recomment using Juno, VS Code, Jupyter, Pluto.jl, Vim, Emacs, SublimeText, and NotePad++ for editors or IDEs.

>3. How do you run programs in that language?
>4. How do you write comments in your language?

Because Julia is very similar to Python, the comment feature works in the same manner. Placing a hash (#) before a line, segment, or word will comment it out.
